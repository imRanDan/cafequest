- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Mapping & Geolocation**: OpenStreetMap, Leaflet.js
- **API Integration**: Nominatim API (for geolocation search), Overpass API (for querying OpenStreetMap data)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Heroku/Netlify (or another hosting platform)

```bash
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=5000
```
5. Start the application in development mode:

Development Notes

    For a smooth development experience, make sure youâ€™ve properly configured Leaflet for the client-side only (e.g., inside useEffect) to prevent errors related to SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
    If you encounter any issues in the development environment (e.g., window is not defined), ensure all client-side code (like map initialization) is wrapped in conditionals that check for the browser environment.
